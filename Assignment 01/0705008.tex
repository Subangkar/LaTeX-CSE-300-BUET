Nicknamed \textbf{\textit{Dukhu Mia}} (Sad Man), Nazrul began attending the maktab — the local religious school run by the mosque — where he studied the Qur'an and other scriptures, Islamic philosophy and theology. His family was devastated with the death of his father in 1908.

\section*{\textcolor{magenta} {\textbf{\LARGE{{Later life and Illness}}}}}

Nazrul's success soon brought him into Indian theatre and the then-nascent film industry. The first picture for which he worked was based on Girish Chandra Ghosh's story \textcolor{blue}{"Bhakta Dhruva"} in 1934.The film "Vidyapati" ("Master of Knowledge") was produced based on his recorded play in 1936, and Nazrul served as the music director for the film adaptation of Tagore's novel \textcolor{blue}{Gora}. He produced critical and analytic documentaries on music, such as \textcolor{blue}{"Haramoni"} and \textcolor{blue}{"Navaraga-malika"}.  He Sought to preserve his artistic integrity by condemning the adaptation of his songs to music composed by others and insisting on the use of tunes he composed himself.








\section*{\textcolor{magenta} {\textbf{\LARGE{{Why Kazi Nazrul Islam is my role model?}}}}} 

The word \textcolor{blue}{role model} implies that  \textcolor{red}{"any person who deserves as an example, whose behaviour is praised by others,who is followed by others"}. Since, it is very easy to find out the qualities of that person you like most, i only focus the behaviour which attracts me most .No doubt \textbf{\textit{Kazi Nazrul Islam}}'s extra-ordinary talent in Bangla literature has made me attractive to him and he is placed in the Heart of mine.
